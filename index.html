  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>The software development process is a strategic procedure used by developers to convert a piece of software from 
    concept to reality. It requires a sequence of stages; Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification and 
    Maintenance. In the Requirements stage, developers work closely with clients to document and define the software’s 
    purpose, features, audience, and constraints. Here, the developer needs to ask questions to ensure clarity on the 
    project's conditions. The Design stage is where the requirements and specifications of the software are converted 
    into a detailed plan for executing the software. The design stage includes writing pseudocode; an algorithm written 
    in basic English that describes the operations the software will perform. The Implementation stage is where the magic 
    happens. Developers write the code based on the requirements and blueprint developed in the previous stages. The 
    Verification stage is where the software is thoroughly tested and weighed against its requirements. The software always 
    undergoes testing with various test scenarios to ensure flawless execution regardless of user errors. The last stage 
    is the Maintenance stage, which includes supplying standby maintenance. This includes providing customer support and 
    software updates. </p>
  <p>Software design is important because poor planning leads to a poor-quality system. When working with 
    a team of developers, proper and concise blueprints promote communication and ensure that everyone on the team is 
    familiar with the software’s architecture. Also, software design allows for seamless maintenance and troubleshooting. 
    If an error arises, a clear outline helps developers find the root cause of the issue.</p>
  <p>Apple inc. ‘Find my’ app is a software that I use daily. It is an app that was clearly developed with its users in mind. 
    The purpose of the software is explicit. You can find devices, items, and people, so long as they’ve shared their location 
    with you. This software has made my life easier, being able to find my lost devices and stay informed about my friends and 
    family’s whereabouts. Aside from its purpose, the app is reliable and consistently performs as expected. Customer support 
    is easily accessible and made available to users. The software is aesthetically pleasing and has a user-friendly interface. 
    It is also compatible across different platforms.</p>
  <p>Software design is not just about programming. It is about communication, planning, collaboration, and maintenance. 
    Though programming is fun, it is the time and energy put into software design that makes the system brilliant</p>
  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 2</h1>
  <p>The Requirements gathering stage is the first of the 5 stages of software design. In this stage, developers work 
    closely with clients to document and define the software’s purpose, features, audience, and constraints. Here, the 
    developer needs to conduct surveys, interviews and workshops to gather information about the software system’s conditions. 
    This stage is essential to the software development process because it sets a firm foundation for the entire project. The 
    requirements-gathering stage outlines clear specifications for the project. Having those requirements on hand helps to ensure 
    that the final product will align with the client’s needs. This stage also helps developers identify potential challenges 
    early on in the software development process. Identifying these challenges may allow project management to estimate how much 
    the system will cost and how long the developers will take to complete the project. This communication between the developers 
    and the client is necessary and professional. In addition, identifying challenges early on also helps to minimize overall risks. 
    Working with a time and budget in mind establishes clear limits and promotes efficiency..</p>

  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 3</h1>
  <p>Chapter 3 of the "Subject to Change" textbook explores the crucial role of empathy in business models. Empathy consists of 3 elements: 
    Emotion, Culture and Context. Emotion is the first element. Scientists have proved that emotions enhance the quality of life. Meaning that 
    the usability of a product quickly diminishes if fails to invoke positive emotions for its user. The "Sheep" model was problematic for this 
    very reason. The "Sheep" model dehumanizes customers by comparing them to sheep– animals that are known to be passive and gullible. This 
    perspective neglects the intelligence, emotions, and individuality of customers. Disregarding emotions in design leads to unsuccessful 
    products and services that fail to address the emotional needs of customers. Culture is second. This element refers to the influence of 
    cultural beliefs, values and norms on people's behaviour and preferences. Culture shapes how individuals interact with products. The “Homo 
    Economicus” model is an example of cultural neglect. The model assumes that individuals are solely rational, and make decisions based on 
    quantity over quality. This simplification ignores how culture shapes people's decision-making processes. Without accounting for culture, 
    the model may attempt to predict user behaviours, resulting in products that do not resonate with diverse audiences. Context is last. Context 
    refers to the situation, environment, intention and tech proficiency of the users experiencing a product. Understanding user context helps in 
    designing products and interfaces that are successful. The "Human Factor" model of users, assumes that people are primarily goal-driven and 
    task-oriented. This view overlooks context; the environmental conditions and physical limitations that a user is operating in/with, which 
    significantly impact how users interact with products or services. Ignoring these contextual elements can lead to designs that don't account 
    for variability, force users into rigid workflows, and are blind to the real-world context of its users.</p>

  <p> In 1888, George Eastman unveiled a world-changing device, the Kodak camera. This was a small, handheld, rectangular-shaped device. No longer
    did users have to carry around bulky and heavy cameras with film that was just as daunting to develop.  With the Kodak camera, Eastman marketed 
    the slogan, “You press the button, we do the rest” and it was revolutionary. Users simply pointed the lens as a subject, pressed the button and 
    the camera did the rest. The Kodak Camera was all about simplicity. This wasn't a product, it was an experience– and an easy one at that. 
    Families could capture the most perfect moments without dreading hours of developing in a darkroom. It was also portable, so individuals could
    take it with them too. This gave everyone the opportunity to be a photographer and Freeze their most beautiful scenes in time</p
  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 5</h1>
  <p> Prototyping is a fundamental concept in software development. It involves creating a simplified and non-functional mock-up/model of a software 
    system’s user interface to help developers understand and tweak the design before building the final software product. Prototypes don’t have full 
    functionality and are focused more on representing the visual design of an average user’s interactions. The use of prototyping is significant in 
    the software development process. Prototypes allow developers to demonstrate concepts in a tangible way. Prototypes are essential in helping 
    developers validate requirements, explore solutions, and ensure that the user interface is actually usable. Prototypes bridge the gap between 
    design intent and actual functionality. Donald A. Norman once said, "Designers know too much about their product to be objective judges: the features 
    they have come to love and prefer may not be understood or preferred by the future customers." Prototyping is crucial in avoiding this bias. Some 
    benefits to prototyping include; Helping the design team understand what the user is thinking, improving system usability and reducing development 
    effort. Prototyping increases user understanding by putting a visual platform to concepts and ideas. It acts as a preventative measure, helping to 
    identify usability issues early on. Prototyping also reduces development efforts by capturing requirements early, preventing costly changes later. 
    Creating and utilizing a paper prototype involves these basic steps: First, identifying the most important user. Next, identifying typical tasks that 
    the user will perform within the software. After, creating screenshots or hand-drawn sketches depicting the user interface, navigation and task 
    interactions. Last, performing a usability test by having users navigate the paper prototype while observing their interactions and gathering feedback.</p
  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 6</h1>
  <p> Effective communication is important in software design. Collaboration is the backbone of any project, so it's important for all parties; clients, 
    developers, and end-users, to be able to communicate clearly. Clear and constant communication is vital in ensuring everyone is on the same page in 
    terms of requirements, architecture, constraints and progress. Without effective communication, necessities may be lost in the requirements-gathering 
    stage, and the prototype made in the design stage may be missing important features. This is an example of how poor communication can lead to errors and delays.
    Effective communication encompasses several key elements:
    1. Flexibility: Developers are bound to interact with diverse markets, fellow coders and non-technical clients. Having the skills to adapt one’s communication 
       style to suit their audience is crucial. Flexibility comes in the form of voice, tone, word choice, or modulation.
    2. Non-verbal communication: In in-person, and virtual meetings, developers can use video conferencing to assess engagement, interest, and approval through 
       facial expressions and body language. Written communication also carries tone and intent. Interpreting these messages is important to understand colleagues' 
       and client’s emotional states.
    3. Active listening: When developers actively listen, they show genuine interest in others' perspectives (empathy), ask clarifying questions to understand the 
       message (requirements gathering) and provide constructive feedback. This practice fosters better problem-solving and teamwork.
    I was once tasked with designing a flyer for a church event. Initially, I received the event information, created a draft, and sought feedback. However, I made 
    the mistake of printing the flyers without confirming there was no further feedback. Turns out, additional feedback surfaced, resulting in an unnecessary waste 
    of flyers. This experience highlighted a communication issue. I should have established a clear feedback process, specifying how/when they would provide feedback. 
    I alsos learned the importance of ensuring complete consensus before proceeding with final productions.</p
  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 7</h1>
  <p>The design principle I’ve chosen for my assignment is the Pareto Principle. Generally, this design principle proposes that for many tasks, about 80% of the results 
    come from 20% of the causes. It's a way of saying that a small part often has a big impact. In the context of software design, the Pareto Principle serves as a guiding 
    design principle. This principle suggests that 80% of the system's value or impact is derived from 20% of its features or components. This principle is often used to 
    guide designers and developers in focusing their efforts on the most critical aspects that contribute to the overall user satisfaction of the software. By identifying 
    and prioritizing this vital 20%, software designers can optimize their work, ensuring that most influential elements of the design work well. This also helps them make 
    users happier without using up too much time or resources. It's like finding the key parts that really matter and making sure they're the best they can be. An example 
    where I observed this principle is on AliExpress. In the context of an e-commerce platform, the Pareto Principle can first be observed in product listings. Generally, 
    the majority of a platform’s sales (roughly 80%) will come from a relatively small portion of listings/categories (about 20%). Uitilizing the Pareto Principle, the 
    platform can enhance user experience by strategically featuring and promoting the top selling products. Another way the Pareto Principle can be observed is in customer 
    support. Designers can analyze support data and identify the main 20% of issues that are creating dissatisfaction for 80% of their users. By intentionally addressing 
    these common problems, designers can minimize the occurrence of major issues. In both examples, leveraging on the Pareto Principle leads to user satisfaction, which is 
    the main goal for software designers.</p>
