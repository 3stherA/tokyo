  <h1>Software Design 1 | Assignment 1</h1>
  <p>The software development process is a strategic procedure used by developers to convert a piece of software from 
    concept to reality. It requires a sequence of stages; Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification and 
    Maintenance. In the Requirements stage, developers work closely with clients to document and define the software’s 
    purpose, features, audience, and constraints. Here, the developer needs to ask questions to ensure clarity on the 
    project's conditions. The Design stage is where the requirements and specifications of the software are converted 
    into a detailed plan for executing the software. The design stage includes writing pseudocode; an algorithm written 
    in basic English that describes the operations the software will perform. The Implementation stage is where the magic 
    happens. Developers write the code based on the requirements and blueprint developed in the previous stages. The 
    Verification stage is where the software is thoroughly tested and weighed against its requirements. The software always 
    undergoes testing with various test scenarios to ensure flawless execution regardless of user errors. The last stage 
    is the Maintenance stage, which includes supplying standby maintenance. This includes providing customer support and 
    software updates. </p>
  <p>Software design is important because poor planning leads to a poor-quality system. When working with 
    a team of developers, proper and concise blueprints promote communication and ensure that everyone on the team is 
    familiar with the software’s architecture. Also, software design allows for seamless maintenance and troubleshooting. 
    If an error arises, a clear outline helps developers find the root cause of the issue.</p>
  <p>Apple inc. ‘Find my’ app is a software that I use daily. It is an app that was clearly developed with its users in mind. 
    The purpose of the software is explicit. You can find devices, items, and people, so long as they’ve shared their location 
    with you. This software has made my life easier, being able to find my lost devices and stay informed about my friends and 
    family’s whereabouts. Aside from its purpose, the app is reliable and consistently performs as expected. Customer support 
    is easily accessible and made available to users. The software is aesthetically pleasing and has a user-friendly interface. 
    It is also compatible across different platforms.</p>
  <p>Software design is not just about programming. It is about communication, planning, collaboration, and maintenance. 
    Though programming is fun, it is the time and energy put into software design that makes the system brilliant</p>
